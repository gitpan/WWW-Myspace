WWW::Myspace - Access MySpace.com from Perl scripts

WWW::Myspace.pm provides methods to access myspace.com accounts and functions
automatically. It provides a simple interface for scripts to log in,
access lists of friends, scan user's profiles, retreive profile
data, and post comments.

Example:

    use WWW::Myspace;
    my $myspace = WWW::Myspace->new ($account, $password);
        OR
    my $myspace = new WWW::Myspace; # Prompts for email and password

    my ( @friends ) = $myspace->get_friends();


PREREQUESITES

HTTP::Request::Form
Spiffy

Each of them has a list of dependencies also.

If you don't have XML::Parser installed,
you'll probably need to manually install expat:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/expat/

On MacOS X you'll need to install the developer tools from your
Tiger install DVD or download them from http://developer.apple.com
or nothing will install and you'll get errors about missing CORE files).
(I haven't tested this on pre-Tiger MacOS, but it should work).

INSTALLATION

Installing using the cpan command-line tool is the easiest
as it will install the dependencies for you.

cpan install WWW::Myspace

Good general advice for installing any CPAN module:
If a module fails to install:
- Starting at the top, scan the copious output cpan will create
- When you see a module has failed to install:
  - cd into the module's directory ( hint: cd ~/.cpan/build ; ls )
  - Read the README for the module and install it manually. You'll
    see the specific errors it's having there.
  - Once it's installed, run your cpan install command again.

If you don't configure cpan to use "sudo make install", you'll probably
want to run the cpan command as root or run "sudo cpan". man cpan
for more info.



To install this module manually, run the following commands:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    sudo make install
