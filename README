WWW::Myspace - Access MySpace.com from Perl scripts

WWW::Myspace.pm provides methods to access myspace.com accounts and functions
automatically. It provides a simple interface for scripts to log in,
access lists of friends, scan user's profiles, retreive profile
data, and post comments.

Example:

    use WWW::Myspace;
    my $myspace = WWW::Myspace->new ($account, $password);
        OR
    my $myspace = new WWW::Myspace; # Prompts for email and password

    my ( @friends ) = $myspace->get_friends();

Each of them has a list of dependencies also.

If you don't have XML::Parser installed,
you may need to manually install expat:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/expat/
Just try installing and if the install fails look through the messages
and see if it says you need expat.

On MacOS X you'll need to install the developer tools from your
Tiger install DVD or download them from http://developer.apple.com
or nothing will install and you'll get errors about missing CORE files).
(I haven't tested this on pre-Tiger MacOS, but it should work with
those developer tools also).

INSTALLATION

Installing using the cpan command-line tool is the easiest
as it will install the dependencies for you.

cpan install WWW::Myspace

or

sudo cpan install WWW::Myspace

Good general advice for installing any CPAN module:
If a module fails to install:
- Starting at the top, scan the copious output cpan will create
- When you see a module has failed to install:
  - cd into the module's directory ( hint: cd ~/.cpan/build ; ls )
  - Read the README for the module and install it manually. You'll
    see the specific errors it's having there.
  - Once it's installed, run your cpan install command again.

If you don't configure cpan to use "sudo make install"
(and you should, for which you'll need cpan 1.83), you'll probably
want to run the cpan command as root or run "sudo cpan". man cpan
for more info.


To install this module manually, run the following commands:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    sudo make install  # Or su root ; make install


The distribution also installs the following convenience modules:
WWW::Myspace::Comment
WWW::Myspace::FriendChanges
WWW::Myspace::Message
WWW::Myspace::FriendAdder

The distribution also installs the following handy scripts:
add_friends
approve_friends
comment_myspace
message_group

These are scripts I use, and decided to include in the
distribution in case they're handy, since they're the most common
uses for the module, and they're a bit more robust and friendly
than just using the methods in the module themselves.


TEST SUITE

WWW::Myspace accesses a web site, which by nature may change.
Such change may break functions in this module.
The test suite (run during cpan installation or when you type
"make test") runs an extensive battery of tests on all methods
against the myspace site. This has a few effects:
1) It makes sure the module works on your system.
2) It makes sure that the module works with the current version
   of the myspace site.
3) If the site changes, or has problems, tests may fail even though
   overall the module will work.
My approach to programming is that the module should be robust
enough to handle the changes in the myspace site, so if condition
3 occurs, the module needs beefing up.

Note that you can re-run the test suite at any time. Keep a copy
of the distribution (hint: cd ~/.cpan/build/WWW-Myspace* ) and
run:
    perl Makefile.PL
    make test

This is handy if you find that something in one of your scripts
stops working and you're wondering if something changed that broke
WWW::Myspace. If the tests pass, it's probably your script. If not,
there'll probably be an update coming soon (make sure you have
the latest version, of course - just re-run the cpan command).

IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT TESTS: As of version 0.40, you can run the full
test suite against your own accounts.  To do so, place a config
file (copy/paste this and change the values) in
~/.www-myspace/test_config.yaml:

---
acct1:
  friend_id: 12345
  username: myspace_login_email_address
  password: myspace_login_password
  user_name: Username # (as it appears in "Hello, username" when you log in.)
acct2:
  friend_id: 
  username: 
  password: 
  user_name: 
test_group: 100009984


See t/config.yaml for an example file (but lacking "username" and "password").

This establishes test data for 2 accounts, "acct1", and "acct2".  You provide
the login info, friendID, and display name for each account. The test
scripts then log into each account and test the module's methods using them.
They'll post comments back and forth, send a message or two, and delete and
add each other as friends.  It should be safe to run on an active account,
but if you feel nervous, set up a couple dummy accounts.

NOTE THAT acct2 MUST BE A PERSONAL (not a band) ACCOUNT, or the is_band
test will fail, causing your tests to fail.


HOW TO SUBMIT A PATCH

To submit a patch for a new feature or a bug fix, please observe the following.
Doing so will allow me to implement your patch quickly.  Not doing so may
delay its implementation or prevent me from implementing your patch at all.

 - Download the newest development version from SVN.
   The command to use is here:
   http://sourceforge.net/svn/?group_id=163042
   (Or see http://sourceforge.net/projects/www-myspace)
 - Apply your changes to that version.
 - Create a unified or context diff of the changed file(s):
   diff -u original_file.pm your_file.pm
 - Email the output to C<bug-www-myspace at rt.cpan.org>, or go to the
   CPAN RT web site (see below) and submit it there.

I will apply your patch and run the tests on it.
