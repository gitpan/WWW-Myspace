# test_next_button
# usage: test_next_button [filename]
# Pass content to check for presence of "next" button via
# STDIN or via a file.
# This is used to test the internal _next_button method
# against various pages to make sure it's identifying them
# properly.  All paging routines use this method and myspace
# displays the button differently on different pages.
